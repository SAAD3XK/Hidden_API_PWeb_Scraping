# Web Crawler for a "hidden API" website
- This crawler scrapes the "All products" page of the website [on-running.com](https://www.on-running.com/en-ch/shop)
- The crawling is a lot of different as the website works on sending requests to hidden APIs and hence normal web crawling techniques won't work here.
- Instead we'll have to directly access those APIs that are being called when we do something like reload a page or press the "Show more" button on a page.
