This crawler scrapes the "All products" page of the website on-running.com
The crawling is a lot of different as the website works on sending requests to hidden APIs and hence normal web crawling techniques won't work here.
Instead we'll have to directly access those APIs that are being called when we do something like reload a page or press the "Show more" button on a page.
